# ExLaunch - Luminescent

This repository contains a fork of Martmists-GH's [BDSP_rombase](https://github.com/Martmists-GH/BDSP_rombase), a base for BDSP mods based on Sigma Platinum. This mod base is free to use by anyone under the terms of the [BSD-3-Clause license](./LICENSE).

It has been modified to be used for Pok√©mon Luminescent.

- Friendship toggle as flag (1753)

### Installation
Installation requires Linux or a WSL instance for the building process.

1. Clone the repository and its submodule using `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/TeamLumi/Luminescent_ExLaunch.git`.
2. Build the project using `cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING="Debug" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH="out/install/WSL-GCC-Debug" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE:FILEPATH="cmake/toolchain.cmake" -Bbuild`.
3. In the `build` directory, make the RomBase target with `make RomBase`.
4. Again, in the `build` directory, make the RomBase_release_x target with `make RomBase_release_x` where x is yuzu, ryujinx, or atmosphere. The only difference between all these targets should be the directory structure of the output.
5. Copy the built files from the corresponding directory in `build/RomBase_Diamond_releases`, or use the existing copy/ftp tasks from cmake.
6. Put `embedded_files/shaders/imgui.bin` at `sdmc:/shaders/imgui.bin` (or `sdcard/shaders/imgui.bin` for Ryujinx)

After the initial installation, only steps 4-6 need to be repeated to rebuild the mod.
